**What we benefitted from this exercise**
Pair programming. Working together in a team has benefitted us immensely as we were able to implement solutions in depth and there was greater consistency in our problem solving techniques.
Familiarisation of the tools used. HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript and Mocha were words that we barely understood at the beginning, let alone understand their uses. Although we still have a lot to learn, we are able to put theory into practice and create something tangible, like this Task-App.


⚠️ **Challenges faced**
Occasional differing opinions on how to approach an issue. We would resolve this by trying all proposed methods and agree on the most effective solution.
Final design varied significantly from the initial wireframe design as it was difficult to achieve desired goals in the limited time that was allocated for each sprint.
Required ID# of each task card to increment automatically but our code was refusing to increment it. Took us a while but we finally figured it was because of the scoping of the instantiated TaskManager class.
Its been a challenge to check for the date input whether it is valid or not. Any input date with previous values are not accepted.

**Testing**
We were introduced to do Mocha testing for the code. We added test cases to test for addtask, submit button, delete button and for done-button.
